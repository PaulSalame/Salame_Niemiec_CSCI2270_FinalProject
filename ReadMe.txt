This project is by Paul Salame and Matt Niemiec. Our project is a calendar to schedule events for the week. The can add events, delete events, print events, find empty blocks of time in their schedule, and perform other functionalities. The implementation idea is to create an array of seven elements (one for each day of the week), each containing a pointer to a linked list of events. 

To use this program, simply follow the instructions in the menus.
